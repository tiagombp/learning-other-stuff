# Applied Perception &mdash Week 1

From patterns of light to... thought.

### What is “Applied Perception”? Why Study It?

Let's start by answering two important questions. First, what is applied perception for visualization? And why study it? I think these are two very important questions that we need to answer from the very beginning. Well, first of all, we need a consideration. Information visualization is about transforming data into a visual representation so that a human can extract useful information out of it. In the previous course, we talked mostly about how to transform data into a visual representation.

But now we need to talk about how humans perceive this information, because the more we know about humans extract information out of visual representations, the more equipped we are with useful information to design effective visualizations. Now, I want to briefly talk about a very important issue here. The issue here is that the effectiveness of a visual representation is not really arbitrary. It's mostly dependent on how the brain works. So, when we talk about visualization, you may be tempted to say, "Or maybe this visualization is better than another visualization, only because I like it and you don't like it." So, it could be described as a matter of subjective preference or taste.

Why subjective preference and taste do play an important role? Here we are concerned with the fact that when we talk about effectiveness, effectiveness is largely dependent on how the brain works. So, understanding how perception works is going to help you make informed decisions about visualization design, which is really important.

Let me give you a very simple example coming from Colin Ware's book, Information Visualization: Perception for Design.

These are two graphs, they try to convey exactly the same information, but I think everyone can readily see that the graph on the left is way easier to interpret than the graph on the right. So, that's an example of the same information displayed in a different way, but in one way is much easier to understand than another and it doesn't really depend on subjective preferences. 

Why is this important for a visualization designer? Well, it's really important because you as a visualization designer, are constantly trying to do two main things. The first one is to ideate visual representations that are appropriate for the problem that you're trying to solve. The second one is that you're constantly evaluating the solutions that you are creating. It's literally never the case that the first visual representation that you create or think about is the best one. So, you're always juggling between ideating something and evaluating something. That's a very common set of operations taking place in visualization design.

Related to that, in visualization design, one problem in visualization design is that, the space of solutions is normally very large. So, if you don't have a way to guide your search in this space of large solutions through some relevant knowledge, you won't be able to very quickly converge to something that works well. 

![](week1_06.PNG)

Think about it. If you don't know how to traverse the space, you're going to have a very hard time converging towards something that is potentially very effective. So, this type of knowledge is very much needed. So, let me try to describe this a little bit more precisely. What I want to introduce here, is the concept of task.

![](week1_07.PNG)

Why is this important? Well, because a moment ago, I just said that in visualization design, we have to think about effectiveness, and knowledge of visual perception is useful because it helps you as a designer to figure out what is effective and what is not effective.

But in order to talk about effectiveness, we have to define the idea of task. Effectiveness cannot exist if we don't tie a visualization design to the concept of a specific task that somebody needs to carry out. So, that's a very important concept. In turn, you as a visualization designer, you are constantly trying to figure out whether a given representation is better than another visual representation. What is really important is to keep in mind that you can only say that the visualization is better than another when you talk about a specific goal or task that somebody needs to accomplish.

![](week1_09.PNG)

That's very important. So, in summary, when somebody asks you, which visualization is better between A and B? I think what you should ask in turn is, to accomplish what? 

![](week1_10.PNG)

Because if you don't ask this question, you won't be able to talk about effectiveness. That's a very important concept. So, in general, your goal as a visualization designer once one or more tasks have been defined, is to predict what works and what does not work, right? Also explain possibly why something works and why it doesn't work. That's the main objective of this course.

The idea here is that, if you know more about how the brain and the visual system works, you will be much better at predicting and explaining why something works or it doesn't work.

So, we now can say that the main goal of this course of Applied Perception of Visualization is to study human perceptual and cognitive processing to make informed decisions about visualization design.

Before I conclude, I just want to clarify what I mean by "informed decisions." I want to do that by giving you an example. Say that you have a map and you want to represent information through color and you have two main questions. The first one is how many colors can an average person distinguish on a map? If you have to convey information about 40 or 50 different categories or concepts, do you actually have 30 or 50 colors available? How do you answer it, this question? You have to know how the visual processing system works.

Once I know how many different colors I can use in a map, I still have another problem. Which colors should I choose? Ideally, I want to choose colors that are as distinguishable as possible. So, how do we know which colors to use. Well, once again, that's a question that you can answer only if you know how the visual processing system works. 

So, let me conclude by giving you a very brief summary of what we're going to cover in this course. First, we're going to cover the visual and cognitive system. So, how the eyes and the brain work and how they process information coming from the world. Second, we're going to talk about the effectiveness of visual channels. So, how every single visual property that can be used to represent data can be used effectively and how effective it is at conveying information. Finally, we will cover color in two weeks. Why color? Because color is very complex and at the same time very important in visualization
