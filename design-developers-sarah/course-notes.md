Sarah debunks the 'right brain vs the left brain' myth, and why it's important to move past this thinking.

People put in their minds that they can't do something. People brag about being bad at design, like that would mean that they're better developers. They're not. They are only bad at design.

Design to entice people, to engage people. 

> "I mostly spend my time coding, but what I do do is I create design so that people are interested in my code."

## Layout

### Scale and Cropping

> So if we have an image and we change the scale of that image instead of plopping it on the page, it becomes a piece of the layout, or it becomes a piece of the grid, or it becomes a little bit more dynamic or interesting.

> So I took this image and I turned it on its side, I blew it up really big. It's actually like a giant image, I'm only showing you a tiny little piece of it. But we get that background, the kind of texture that most people wouldn't have even noticed in the image, and it's not important, right? It's not important that people understand every bit of what's in that image. What they need to see and understand is that their's a little bit of coffee beans and also that maybe it's not the most important, it's not the focal point of this design, it's a table, right?

### Grid

> So what do I mean by using a grid and making a grid? Well, one of the things that we're doing when we create with grids, and it doesn't necessarily have to be just one solid grid that you're following every piece of that grid. But it's really this idea that you're anchoring things to one another, that things aren't just thrown around on your design, that you have many different elements, they all have a thing that they're locking to.

> Because look at that line at the top, right? That's like a really curvy, not part of a grid system line. They're breaking the grid in order to bring that line. But everything is anchored to something else. Nothing is just thrown onto to the page. And if I took this design and just moved things a little bit, so they weren't anchored anymore.

> You wouldn't like it anymore. I know it's sounds crazy, but you would be like it feels disorganised, it just feels little chaotic. So this idea of anchoring things to one another in order to bring them on to the picture, and they're not even anchored in a way where like A goes to B, goes to C goes to D it's not the thing at the bottom is anchored to the thing on the side.

> The "patterns in design" baseline, is lined up here, that nationwide remember we talked about curves and circles needing to etch out a little bit from those lines, that's what they're doing right there.

> This is another one of those things where once I explain this and you see it, you will not stop seeing it anywhere.
