>> Sarah Drasner: Remember we were talking about HSL and generative color and stuff? Someone who uses that a lot is my friend Nadi Bremmer who does these amazing data visualizations. If you've ever seen one of Shirley Lou's classes, she's a collaborator with Nadi. The two of them together is like genius crazy awesome.

So now that you know a bit about HSL color and how that all works you can kind of understand how something like this might be built when they're using these kind of generative colors that are definitely the same lightness and saturation but they're moving across the color spectrum.

Right, pretty cool. Awesome.
