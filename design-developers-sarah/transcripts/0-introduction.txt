>> Sarah Drasner: I'm Sarah Drasner. I'm really excited to be here today. I, this is the first course I've ever taught that I made the materials because people asked me to. So this course is called Design For Developers. I worked for Microsoft as a Senior Developer Advocate, I also worked for CSS-Tricks as a staff writer.

[00:00:23]
We're gonna see some of the CSS-Tricks in the slide decks today. And I also, I'm on the Vue Core team.
