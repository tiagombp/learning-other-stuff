>> Sarah Drasner: All right, use any of the tools and techniques you just learned and create a palette of five colors. Then create five grays and blacks. Then apply that to your last composition. So when I say apply that to your last composition, you don't have to put it everywhere, right?

[00:00:14]
You don't have to like stick it everywhere because probably somewhere in that composition is a photo. Somewhere in that composition is some text. But if you see little places where you can add accents, take one of your primary colors and apply it there. All right, if you see a little place that has accents.

If you don't have a place to add accents of different colors, add them. Cool, sound great? Okay.
