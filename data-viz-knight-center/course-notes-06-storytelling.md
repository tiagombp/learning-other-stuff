### Module 6 video 1: From data to stories: an introduction to the module

### Module 6 video 2: What is data storytelling?

> But it's important to keep that definition of what we do and kind of what data storytelling is a bit vague. After all, it's still evolving.

> Data storytelling itself exists in the sweet spot between the two. It combines the function of academic and science data with the form of data art. It's sometimes described as edutainment because it both informs and delights. And what differentiates data storytelling is that your goal is to reach the broadest audience possible and to communicate a clear narrative and clear takeaways.
