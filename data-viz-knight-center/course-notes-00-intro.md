The course materials are organized into six weekly modules.

Each weekly module will feature videos, presentations, readings, discussion forums, and messages from the instructors. The video classes will include both conceptual and practical videos to help enhance your understanding and practical application of the material. **There will be a quiz each week to test the knowledge you've gained from the course materials. The weekly quizzes, and weekly participation in the discussion forums, are the basic requirements for earning an optional certificate of participation at the end of the course.**

We recommend that you complete each of the following before the end of each week so you don’t fall behind:
